Welcome to this first unit, where **you'll build a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI Agents** including:

- **Understanding Agents**  
  - What is an Agent, and how does it work?  
  - How do Agents make decisions using reasoning and planning?

- **The Role of LLMs (Large Language Models) in Agents**  
  - How LLMs serve as the “brain” behind an Agent.  
  - How LLMs structure conversations via the Messages system.

- **Tools and Actions**  
  - How Agents use external tools to interact with the environment.  
  - How to build and integrate tools for your Agent.

- **The Agent Workflow:** 
  - *Think* → *Act* → *Observe*.

After exploring these topics, **you’ll build your first Agent** using `smolagents`! 

Your Agent, named Alfred, will handle a simple task and demonstrate how to apply these concepts in practice. 

You’ll even learn how to **publish your Agent on Hugging Face Spaces**, so you can share it with friends and colleagues.

Finally, at the end of this Unit, you'll take a quiz. Pass it, and you'll **earn your first course certification**: the 🎓 Certificate of Fundamentals of Agents.
